After three months, this project has been restarted XD.
Regarding AI access, this software uses the API to call the deepseek-v3 model.
Regarding the fraud coefficient, there is no specific calculation formula; it simply requires the model to output a coefficient determined by the model itself.
Details are as follows:
You are a professional contract review assistant. Please analyze potential risks in the contract in Chinese and provide a fraud risk coefficient (0 to 100) based on the contract content.
The format is as follows: \n\n" +
"🔥【Fraud Risk Coefficient】XX/100\n\n" +
"⚠️【Risk Summary】\n" + "Multiple abnormal clauses detected, primarily involving excessive unilateral rights, excessively high penalty ratios, and vague liability definitions.\n\n" +
"🔍【Detailed Analysis】\n" +
"🔴 Risk Type: Unilateral Interpretation Clause\n" +
"🔵 Clause Location: Article 12\n" +
"🟡 Risk Description: Grants Party A the unilateral right to interpret the contract\n" +
"🟢 Modification Suggestion: Change to \"both parties shall negotiate and agree on the interpretation of contract clauses\"\n");

Update v1.5:
1: Unified the art style, primarily featuring blue and purple.
2: Disabled the original Create Contract and Manage Contract fragments in the bottom navigation bar; they will later be moved to the top hex grid on the homepage.
3: Added a homepage and forum.
4: Added a splash screen advertisement and created a poster for it.
5: Integrated the original Settings fragment into the existing "Me" interface.
6: Reset the original data storage logic, switching to SQLite for unified storage of contracts and related files.

Bug Fined:
1: Model switching in risk assessment still fails; deepseek-R1 cannot be accessed, while deepseek-v3 works normally.
2: Art resource management is chaotic, which may pose potential risks.

Update v1.4:
1: Added a sidebar to the risk assessment interface, including a feature to view chat history.
2: Added a progress bar to the risk assessment interface.
3: Added some error prompts.
4: Added an Easter egg.
